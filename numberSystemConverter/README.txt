At this moment we have 2 Functions

1 - decimal_to(dec,system)   :   (num: Any, system: Any) -> None 
    * which convert decimal to other number systems
    * Takes 2 arguments adn return nothing
            1 - decimal number which we want to convert to another number system
            2 - In which number system we want it to converted 
                    2 - Binry
                    8 - Octal
                    16 - Hexa decimal

2 - to_decimal(num, system)   :     (num: Any, system: Any) -> None
    * which convert any number to decimal
    * Taes 2 arguments and return nothing
            1 - the number we want to convert to decimal
            2 -  in which number system it is at the moment
                    2 - Binry
                    8 - Octal
                    16 - Hexa decimal
